    "- There are many ways to solve a problem\n",
    "- But which way of solving is better?\n",
    "    - Big O tells us which way of solving a problem is mre efficient than the rest\n",
    "- Why does efficiency matter?\n",
    "    - Because, if the solution is not efficient, when the system grows larger, the time to solve the problem will grow bigger.\n",
    "- Efficient solution to a problem = less time + less space\n",
    "- Sometimes we need to choose between time or space\n",
    "    - Big O helps to choose the solution for the right trade-off between space and time\n",
    "- Big O is a formal way of expressing how runtime grows with input. (For an algorithm, if you give n inputs, how long will it take to complete the given problem)\n",
    "- Big O is considered with worse case scenario (Given a problem, how much time will it take AT MOST or upper bound)\n",
    "- Things to consider:\n",
    "    1. Number of operations is not related to the length of an array (Operation means assignment / addition / multiplication/ division etc.)\n",
    "        - So number of operations' complexity can be considered constant or O(1)\n",
    "    2. Number of iterations multiplies the operations by a factor of n. \n",
    "        -So n iterations of any number of operations for a single loop has complexity of\n",
    "    3. Ignore constant. all constant will evaluate to O(1).\n",
    "    4. When considering higher degree of polynomial. The highest polynomial will be considered the final complexity.\n",
    "        - For a complexity of O(n * n) + O(n), it will be considere O(n * n)\n",
    "        - This is because the increase in higher polynomial for each input is so big that the lower polynomial's increase does not consider much of an addition (too negligible amount)\n",
    "    5. Time complexity = When you are considering number of inputs\n",
    "    6. Space complexity = When you are considering number of variables\n",
    "        - appending value in a list inside a for loop evaluates to O(n) space complexity.\n",
    "        - Matrix has a space complexity of O(M) for m number of rows * O(N) for n number of columns  = O(MN)  \n",
    "        - Is it taking up more memory with each input. Yes. 1 new space in the list for each new input.\n",
    "        - Hash table = O(n) ... This is python dictionaries, map etc."
